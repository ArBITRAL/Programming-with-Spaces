Let us program our first "hello world!" example.

Before starting, go to the main page of [pSpaces](../) and choose a programming language. Follow the instructions to install it.

We will create a simple program that illustrates the most basic features of spaces. The complete code can be found:
- [Hello World in Go](https://github.com/pSpaces/goSpace/blob/master/examples/HelloWorld/main.go)
- [Hello World in Java]
- [Hello World in C#]

We will go through it step by step

Go
```Go
func main(){
}
```

Java
