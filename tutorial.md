This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to programming with spaces. We use the Go implemenation of spaces ([goSpace](https://github.com/pSpaces/goSpace)) in the code examples, but most explanations are generic and can be easily adapted to other programming languages.

The chapters are:
1. [Programming with Spaces](tutorial-tuple-spaces.md)
2. [Concurrent Programming with Spaces](tutorial-concurrent-programming.md)
